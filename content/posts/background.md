My name is Grant Foster, and I am from New Jersey in the United States. I am a recent graduate of the University of Miami, where I studied Neuroscience and Chemistry. I was a research assistant during my time, first in Biophysics and Physiology, then switched into Cognitive Neuroscience. I am now taking my future into the field of Medical Devices & Diagnostics. Here at iX, I am in the crash course of Data Science! I am super excited to see what these field has for me, and to be able to take my skills into the near future!
